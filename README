External Dependencies:
-----------------------------

1. Works with .NET 4.0 CLR - NOT Bundled with this installer. Please go to Microsoft.com and download the .NET 4.0 CLR if not already present on your machine. Windows 7 SP1 has .NET 4.0 CLR installed.

2. msysgit - The latest 'Git-1.8.5.2-preview20131230' has been packaged with the installer. Please install this when prompted and just go ahead without doing any customizations.

For convenience I have packaged the needed installers for the above SW in this installer. Install them as needed.

Please make sure that the proper options are Setup and you have clicked on Fix powershell and Fix SSH Config. This needs to be done only once. You will also get the git-bash front installed through which other tasks like git commit, etc. can be handled.
